Title: Predicting Daily COVID-19 Hospitalization Cases using Bayesian Linear Regression

Problem: We will predict new daily COVID-19 hospitalization cases in multiple Texas using previous hospitalization & mortality data, population mobility, demographics, mask usage, local control policies, weather, and demonstration & protest activity. Predicting COVID-19 hospitalization cases is critical to virus response. Moreover, using an interpretable linear regression framework will allow us to assess the importance of the different covariates such as mask compliance on hospitalization rates. 

Datasets: We chose to use a combination of datasets from Johns Hopkins, the New York Times, and Google’s Mobility Report. The Johns Hopkins data contains features such as the number of tests, deaths, and recovered cases as well as mortality and hospitalization rates. The New York Times data contains features describing the prevalence of mask wearing by county (split into proportion of population that responded “Never”, “Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Frequently”, and “Always” to a survey). Finally, Google’s Mobility Report contains time series data on the percent change from baseline levels of visits to locations such as retail locations, grocery stores, and parks.

Distribution & model: We intend to use Poisson regression, but anticipate possibly needing to switch to gamma or normal regression once we take a closer look at the data and check assumptions.

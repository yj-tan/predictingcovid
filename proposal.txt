Title: Predicting Daily COVID-19 Hospitalization Cases using Bayesian Linear Regression

Problem: We will predict new daily COVID-19 hospitalization cases in multiple Texas using previous hospitalization & mortality data, population mobility, demographics, mask usage, local control policies, weather, and demonstration & protest activity. Predicting COVID-19 hospitalization cases is critical to virus response. Moreover, using an interpretable linear regression framework will allow us to assess the importance of the different covariates such as mask compliance on hospitalization rates. 

Datasets: We chose to use a combination of datasets from Johns Hopkins, the New York Times, and Google’s Mobility Report. The Johns Hopkins data contains features such as the number of tests, deaths, and recovered cases as well as mortality and hospitalization rates. The New York Times data contains features describing the prevalence of mask wearing by county (split into proportion of population that responded “Never”, “Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Frequently”, and “Always” to a survey). Finally, Google’s Mobility Report contains time series data on the percent change from baseline levels of visits to locations such as retail locations, grocery stores, and parks.

  Using this guy's notebook which has mapped counties to nearest weather station: https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-weather-health-covid19-data#header
Protest and Demonstration Data: https://countlove.org/#guns 
  Ended up not using because unreliable
Kaiser Family Foundation Control Policy Data: https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/ 
  Ended up including through the notebook listed under NOAA above.

Distribution & model: We intend to use Poisson regression, but anticipate possibly needing to switch to gamma or normal regression once we take a closer look at the data and check assumptions.
